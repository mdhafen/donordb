First a few requirements.

Module Dependancies (with Debian package name in parenthesis)

mysql (php5-mysql)
ldap (php5-ldap) (Optional)
PEAR (php-pear)
Mail/RFC822 (php-mail)
MCrypt (php5-mcrypt)

Module Dependancies that are probably included with PHP
PDO
Hash


Next some configuration.

In the modules/lib/config.pm file there are a few configuration settings that
need to be set before anything else.

secure_phrase =>  This is basically a short random character string used in the
security module to make the stored passwords harder to un-encrypt.

database => Fill in at least the database connection information for the 'core'
'write' database identifier.  This will be the default database connection.
It is possible to have a 'read' identifier here as well, in order to balance
read and write database access across different servers.

authen_modules => external =>  Enter the database connection identifier (i.e. 'core') here
if you will use one of the provided modules for getting user information from
an external source.  One module has been provided for connecting to the
PowerSchool student information system.

user_external_module =>  This is the identifier for the module to be used for
getting user information from an external source.  This identifier should match
code in modules/lib/external_user_module.pm for linking to the external
information source.

trusted_proxies => This is a list of load balancers in order for the application
url to be guessed.  The load balancer is expected to set the
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SERVER and HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO http headers, along with the
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SSL and HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT http headers as applicable.

Third, you will need to configure the web server.  In the apache web server it
should be as easy as creating the virtual host entry with the document root
set to the webroot folder of the application.

Fourth, you will need to configure cron, or some similar scheduled execution
program, to run the scripts in the scripts/cron directory.  The message queue
processing script should be run daily.

Fifth, you will need to import some information into the database.  The file,
install.sql, will create the table structure.

Sixth, for those not using the external user module.  Point a web browser at
/install.php to begin creating users.
